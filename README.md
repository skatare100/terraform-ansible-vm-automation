 Terraform + Ansible VM Automation  

### Streamlining Virtual Machine Provisioning with Terraform & Ansible  

This project leverages **Terraform** for infrastructure automation and **Ansible** for configuration management, enabling seamless VirtualBox VM provisioning. The goal is to eliminate manual setup and standardize deployments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  

---

##  Features  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Define, provision, and manage VMs with Terraform.  
- **Automated Configuration** – Use Ansible to set up and configure the VM post-deployment.  
- **Reproducibility** – Ensures consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.  
- **Local Environment** – Runs entirely on VirtualBox, avoiding cloud costs.
